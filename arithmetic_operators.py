import math

# Most of the arithmetic operations are the same as C++
# Except for power operator (** power)

num = 5
num = num ** 3

print(num)
# Built in Math functions
# round(x, y) rounds x to y decimal points
# abs(x) gives the absolute value of the number
# pow(num, exp) gives the (num) to the power of (exp)
# max(x, y, z, ...) gives the max number from the list
# min(x, y, z, ...) gives the min number from the list

# Using import math gives us some math numbers and functions to use
# math.pi gives the value of pi
# math.e gives the value of the e (exponential value)
# math.sqrt(x) gives the square root of x
# math.ceil(x) rounds the value of x up
# math.floor(x) rounds the value of x down
